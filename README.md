# VeryShittySerializer

## WARNING: Before you try to refactor this code bear in mind it was written very poorly and any change can (and probably will) break it. 
## YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

### Keep In Mind:

- The Objects that are deserialized won't call any constructor. (Actually it will call a constructor if the args for it are empty, otherwise just wont call them)
